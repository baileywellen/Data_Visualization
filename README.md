# Data_Visualization
**Portfolio displaying projects completed in an undergraduate course, "Business Geographics and Data Visualization". Tools include Tableau, ArcGIS, and more.**   
  
*Note - Tableau Files cannot be previewed in Github. See the Project descriptions below, but to view the data analysis, you must download the .twb or .twbx files* 

  
## Objectives Met:  16 / 17
**1. Install and Run Tableau: Install Tableau Desktop and be able to create, open, save, and share a workbook.**   
[Download Lab1](./Lab1.twbx)  

**2. Add data to Tableau workbook: Bring a variety of data sources into Tableau and utilize basic data processing in Tableau**    
[Download Lab2](./Lab2.twbx) 

**3. Create basic visualizations: Use Tableau to create a variety of visualizations as appropriate to for the data being used.**  
[Download Lab3](./Lab3.twbx) 

**4. Perform calculations in Tableau: Calculate fields and create functions in Tableau**    
[Download Lab4 ("CO2_Emissions_byState.twbx") ](./CO2_Emissions_byState.twbx)  

**5. Work with tables in Tableau: Be able to create and process table calculations in Tableau**     
[Download Lab5](./Lab5.twbx)  

**6. Create maps in Tableau: Use Tableau to do basic geospatial analysis.**    
[Download Lab6](./Lab6.twbx) or [Read the Description](./Lab6_Description.pdf)

**7. Mapping with ArcGIS online: Use the online version of ESRI's ArcGIS for basic geospatial processing.**   
**8. Do statistical analysis in Tableau: Use Tableau for basic statistical analysis**     
**9. Create Interactive Dashboards: Use Tableau to create a dashboard**     
**10. Publish data visualizations with Tableau: Use Tableau to make visualizations available to the public**     
**11. Clean and prepare data for Tableau: Clean and combine data in Tableau to prepare it for analysis. This will include some basic database concepts**     
**12. Using alternate tools: Everything that we do can be done with other software. Demonstrate that by using both Tableau and another tool to produce/process the same visualization (Due to T6-Alt, ArcGIS online is NOT eligible for this objective).**     
**13. Demonstrate an understanding of data context.**     
**14. Choose an appropriate and effective visual**    
**15. Minimize clutter and focus the audience attention.**     
**16. Apply elements of design to visualization**    
**17. Create a data-based story**
