# Data_Visualization
**Portfolio displaying projects completed in an undergraduate course, "Business Geographics and Data Visualization". Tools include Tableau, ArcGIS, and more.**   
  
*Note - Tableau Files cannot be previewed in Github. See the Project descriptions below, but to view the data analysis, you must download the .twb or .twbx files*  

## Objectives:
1. [Install and Run Tableau: Install Tableau Desktop and be able to create, open, save, and share a workbook.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_1)   
2. [Add data to Tableau workbook: Bring a variety of data sources into Tableau and utilize basic data processing in Tableau](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_2)    
3. [Create basic visualizations: Use Tableau to create a variety of visualizations as appropriate to for the data being used.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj-3)  
4. [Perform calculations in Tableau: Calculate fields and create functions in Tableau](./Class_Objectives.md#obj-4)    
5. Work with tables in Tableau: Be able to create and process table calculations in Tableau   
6. Create maps in Tableau: Use Tableau to do basic geospatial analysis.   
7. Mapping with ArcGIS online: Use the online version of ESRI's ArcGIS for basic geospatial processing.     
8. Do statistical analysis in Tableau: Use Tableau for basic statistical analysis   
9. Create Interactive Dashboards: Use Tableau to create a dashboard   
10. Publish data visualizations with Tableau: Use Tableau to make visualizations available to the public     
11. Clean and prepare data for Tableau: Clean and combine data in Tableau to prepare it for analysis.     
12. Using alternate tools: Everything that we do can be done with other software. Demonstrate that by using both Tableau and
 another tool to produce/process the same visualization (Due to T6-Alt, ArcGIS online is NOT eligible for this objective).    
13. Demonstrate an understanding of data context   
14. Choose an appropriate and effective visual  
15. Minimize clutter and focus the audience attention.   
16. Apply elements of design to visualization   
17. Create a data-based story
