# Data_Visualization
**Portfolio displaying projects completed in an undergraduate course, "Business Geographics and Data Visualization". Tools include Tableau, ArcGIS, and more.**   
  
*Note - Tableau Files cannot be previewed in Github. See the Project descriptions below, but to view the data analysis, you must download the .twb or .twbx files*  

## Objectives:
1. [Install and Run Tableau: Install Tableau Desktop and be able to create, open, save, and share a workbook.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_1)   
2. [Add data to Tableau workbook: Bring a variety of data sources into Tableau and utilize basic data processing in Tableau](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_2)    
3. [Create basic visualizations: Use Tableau to create a variety of visualizations as appropriate to for the data being used.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_3)   
4. [Perform calculations in Tableau: Calculate fields and create functions in Tableau](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_4)    
5. [Work with tables in Tableau: Be able to create and process table calculations in Tableau](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_5)      
6. [Create maps in Tableau: Use Tableau to do basic geospatial analysis.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_6)     
7. [Mapping with ArcGIS online: Use the online version of ESRI's ArcGIS for basic geospatial processing.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_7)       
8. [Do statistical analysis in Tableau: Use Tableau for basic statistical analysis](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_8)   
9. [Create Interactive Dashboards: Use Tableau to create a dashboard](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_9)   
10. Publish data visualizations with Tableau: Use Tableau to make visualizations available to the public (not met yet)     
11. [Clean and prepare data for Tableau: Clean and combine data in Tableau to prepare it for analysis.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_11)     
12. [Using alternate tools: Everything that we do can be done with other software. Demonstrate that by using both Tableau and another tool to produce/process the same visualization (Due to T6-Alt, ArcGIS online is NOT eligible for this objective).](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_12)    
13. [Demonstrate an understanding of data context](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_13)   
14. [Choose an appropriate and effective visual](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_14)  
15. [Minimize clutter and focus the audience attention.](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_15)     
16. [Apply elements of design to visualization](./Class_Objectives.md#obj_16)     
17. Create a data-based story (not met yet)
