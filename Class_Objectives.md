## Objective 1  
Install and Run Tableau: Install Tableau Desktop and be able to create, open, save, and share a workbook.

[Download Lab1](./tableau_workbooks/Lab1.twbx)  

## Objective 2  
Add data to Tableau workbook: Bring a variety of data sources into Tableau and utilize basic data processing in Tableau

[Download Lab2](./tableau_workbooks/Lab2.twbx) 

## Objective 3  
Create basic visualizations: Use Tableau to create a variety of visualizations as appropriate to for the data being used.

## Objective 4  
Perform calculations in Tableau: Calculate fields and create functions in Tableau    
[Download Lab4 ("CO2_Emissions_byState.twbx") ](./tableau_workbooks/CO2_Emissions_byState.twbx)  

## Objective 5  
Work with tables in Tableau: Be able to create and process table calculations in Tableau       
[Download Lab5](./tableau_workbooks/Lab5.twbx)  

## Objective-6  
Create maps in Tableau: Use Tableau to do basic geospatial analysis.     
[Download Lab6](./tableau_workbooks/Lab6.twbx) or [Read the Description](./documents/Lab6_Description.pdf)

## 7. Mapping with ArcGIS online: Use the online version of ESRI's ArcGIS for basic geospatial processing.   
[See my Air Quality Map Online](https://arcg.is/1rHu98)  

## 8. Do statistical analysis in Tableau: Use Tableau for basic statistical analysis      
In the first tab (Square Feet Confidence Interval), I see that the average square feet for houses with attached garages is much higher than square feet for houses with detached or no garage. This offers a possible reason why houses with attached garages had a higher sold price, and confirms our hunch that there were confounding factors behind our previous graph.

In addition, we see some counties which would likely have a small p value if we ran a significance test - notably, Milwaukee and Ozaukee are outside of the confidence interval for attached garages; Kenosha, Racine, and Walworth are out of the confidence interval for detached; and Washington is well above the confidence interval for the no garage category.

## 9. Create Interactive Dashboards: Use Tableau to create a dashboard.      
[Download Lab 9](./tableau_workbooks/Lab9.twbx)    

## 10. Publish data visualizations with Tableau: Use Tableau to make visualizations available to the public      
None so far  

## 11. Clean and prepare data for Tableau: Clean and combine data in Tableau to prepare it for analysis. This will include some basic database concepts      
[See in class workbook](./tableau_workbooks/InClass9-28.twbx)  

## 12. Using alternate tools: Everything that we do can be done with other software. Demonstrate that by using both Tableau and another tool to produce/process the same visualization (Due to T6-Alt, ArcGIS online is NOT eligible for this objective).       
[See Lab7 - "fatal-police-shootings.xlsx"](./documents/fatal-police-shootings.xlsx)  

## 13. Demonstrate an understanding of data context.
